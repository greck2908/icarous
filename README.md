Integrated Configurable Algorithms for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems
========

ICAROUS (Integrated Configurable Algorithms for Reliable Operations of
Unmanned Systems) is a software architecture that enables the robust integration
of mission specific software modules and highly assured core software
modules for building safety-centric autonomous unmanned aircraft
applications. The set of core software modules includes formally
verified algorithms that detect, monitor, and control conformance
to safety criteria; avoid stationary obstacles and maintain a safe
distance from other users of the airspace; and compute resolution
and recovery maneuvers, autonomously executed by the autopilot, when
safety criteria are violated or about to be violated.

The ICAROUS package is currently available in C++ and Java. Both versions of ICAROUS have the same functionalities.
The default version of ICAROUS supports the MAVLink protocol (v1.0). You can define your own interfaces for other protocols (See C++/src/INTERFACE for examples)

### Current Releases

- ICAROUS C++: V-1.3.1 - June 19, 2018
- ICAROUS Java: V-1.2.3 - January 19, 2018

### REQUIRED PACKAGES

The following repositories are required to run ICAROUS (You will also have to update the submodules in these repositories if available)

- [Ardupilot](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git) (Only required for software in the loop simulations)
- [mavlink](https://github.com/ArduPilot/mavlink.git) (commit 5de84bb1c)
- [MAVProxy](https://github.com/ArduPilot/MAVProxy.git)
- [Java simple serial connector (JSSC)](https://code.google.com/archive/p/java-simple-serial-connector/) (Already provided in `Java/lib`)
- [Core Flight System](https://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (Already provided)

### BEFORE LAUNCHING ICAROUS

ICAROUS uses several messages that are not part of the common/ardupilotmega MAVlink message set. To ensure that the MAVProxy ground station can receive these custom messages, perform the following steps:

- copy icarous.xml in the `msg/` folder in the icarous repository to `mavlink/message_definitions/v1.0` in the mavlink repository.
- (re)install pymavlink library to incorporate the new dialect (icarous.xml). To do this, goto `mavlink/pymavlink` and run:

```
    $python setup.py install
```

- Install the custom modules provided as part of the ICAROUS repository:

```
    $cd Python/CustomModules
    $bash SetuMavProxy.sh <Location of MAVProxy/>
```

### LAUNCHING ICAROUS

The various parameters that control the behavior of ICAROUS can be found in `params/icarous.txt` under Java or C++. The default parameters found in icarous.txt were selected after several flight tests to yield acceptable performances. For convenience, a script (run.sh) is provided to launch ICAROUS and other supporting applications. The run script also helps configure several port options.

To run ICAROUS on a companion computer for Ardupilot, first make sure that the pixhawk port and baud rate settings in the run script are the same as the telemetry port settings on the pixhawk. First lauch the ICAROUS application as follows:

	$nohup ./run.sh PX4R params/icarous.txt > pxout.txt &

Note that the nohup (no hang up) command enables the application to run as a background process without interruption. 

Once the above two application is launched, you should be able to receive data via the telemetry link connected to the ground station (e.g. mission planner/mavproxy).

We strongly recommend using MAVProxy as a ground station to communicate with ICAROUS. To simplify uploading geofence data to ICAROUS, additional modules are provided in `Python/CustomModules`. The MAVProxy ground station can be lauched using the run script:

    $./run.sh GS

Waypoints can be uploaded from MAVProxy using the `wp` command. An example waypoint is provided in `Java/params`

	wp load params/flightplan.txt

Geofence can be uploaded from MAVProxy using the `geofence` command. An example geofence file is provided in `Java/params`

	geofence load params/geofence.xml

Once waypoints and geofence are uploaded, the mission can be started from MAVProxy as follows:

    long MISSION_START

### Running ICAROUS with the ardupilot SITL


Setup and launch the ardupilot SITL as described in <http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html>. Specify the SITL host address in the run script. By default, the ardupilot SITL is configured to output packets to udp port 14551. Launch ICAROUS in the SITL mode as follows:

    $./run.sh SITL params/icarous.txt

While running ICAROUS in the SITL framework, it is possible to communicate with ICAROUS via a ground station using the UDP sockets instead of using a radio link. See `GS_MASTER` variable in the run.sh script to enable the ground station over a UDP socket.

### Detect and Avoid (DAA) and Geofencing Capabilities

ICAROUS integrates NASA's open source software packages [DAIDALUS](http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/DAIDALUS)
(Detect and Avoid Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems) and
[PolyCARP](http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/PolyCARP) (Algorithms and Software
for Computations with Polygons). DAIDALUS provides detect and avoid
capabilities, while PolyCARP provides geofencing capabilities.

These capabilities are illustrated in the sample programs
[`DAAGeofencingExample.java`](Java/src/DAAGeofencingExample.java) and
[`DAAGeofencingExample.cpp`](C++/src/DAAGeofencingExample.cpp).
